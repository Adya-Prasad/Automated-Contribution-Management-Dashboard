## Automated Contribution Management Dashboard

Key Features Demonstrated:

    Automated PR tracking

    Stale PR identification

    Basic automation rules

    Dual CI/CD integration (GitHub + Jenkins)

    Visual dashboard

    Security considerations (token storage)


Extensions (If Time Permits):

    Add automated documentation generation

    Implement PR triage labels

    Add maintainer notification system

    Create real-time updates with WebSockets

1. Foundation First Approach

    What we did: Started with Django project setup and core models

    Why:

        Establishes clear data structure (PRs/Repos) early

        Enables immediate interaction with GitHub API

        Creates foundation for incremental feature addition

        Follows Django's "models first" philosophy

2. Dual CI/CD Implementation

    What we did: Integrated both GitHub Actions and Jenkins

    Why:

        Demonstrates flexibility with different automation tools

        Matches Django's actual mixed infrastructure

        Provides fallback mechanism understanding

        Shows CI/CD pattern recognition skills

3. Progressive Automation

    What we did: Built automation in layers:

        Data collection (PR tracking)

        Scheduled workflows

        Active management (stale PR handling)

    Why:

        Reduces initial complexity

        Allows testing components independently

        Mirrors real-world automation rollout patterns

        Creates natural checkpoints for validation

4. Security-Conscious Design

    What we did:

        Token encryption

        Environment variables

        Error handling in API calls

    Why:

        Demonstrates production-grade thinking

        Aligns with Django's security-first ethos

        Builds trust for actual deployment

        Teaches safe automation practices

5. Actionable Visualization

    What we did: Created dashboard with:

        Key metrics

        Stale PR tracking

        Recent activity feed

    Why:

        Provides immediate value visualization

        Helps identify automation candidates

        Mirrors Django's contributor dashboard needs

        Creates feedback loop for improvements

6. Test-First Methodology

    What we did: Suggested using dummy repos first

    Why:

        Safe experimentation environment

        Allows destructive testing

        Reduces pressure during learning

        Matches Django's cautious approach to changes

Key Technical Choices Rationale:

    PyGithub Library: Standard, maintained API wrapper

    SQLite: Quick setup for prototyping

    Cron Scheduling: Universal timing mechanism

    Model-Centric Design: Enables future Django Admin integration

    Template-Based UI: Balances simplicity with functionality

This approach creates a vertical slice demonstrating:

    API integration

    Data modeling

    Scheduled automation

    Security practices

    Monitoring/Reporting

    CI/CD implementation
